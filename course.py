Conclusion

Strings are instrumental in storing important, security-related data, such as device IDs and URLs.
String concatenation allows you to easily combine information in a string with the information stored in another string.
String slicing is a powerful technique that enables you to extract any subsection of a string.
Python has many functions and methods that help analysts work with string values, as well as data that they want to convert to string format.
    The type() function returns the data type of its input.
    The str() function converts the input object into a string. For example, when called on an integer, str() returns that integer value converted to a string.
    The len() function returns the number of elements in an object. When called on a string, len() returns the number of characters in that string.
    The .index() method finds the first occurrence of the input in a string and returns its location. It provides the index where the substring begins.

"""
Conclusion
    Indexing a list is similar to indexing a string. Index values start at 0.
    The .append() method helps you add new elements to the end of lists.
    The .remove() method helps you remove elements from lists.
    The .index() method can be used on different types of sequences. They can be used not only with strings, but also with lists.
        With a list, the .index() method allows you to identify the position where a specified element is located in that list.
    If two lists contain information that correspond to each other in a specific order, you can use indices to pair elements from the lists together.
    Functions can be used to develop algorithms. When defining a function, you must specify the parameters it takes in and the actions it should execute.
